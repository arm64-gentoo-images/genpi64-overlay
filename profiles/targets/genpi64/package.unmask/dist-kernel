# Unmask only the versions of the dist-kernel package that we have in the genpi64
# overlay, so that the raspberrypi-kernel package only pulls in our own versions.
# technically it's possible that upstream gentoo will define their own copies
# of these, but these specific versions are already older than what's in gentoo's
# repo, so the likelyhood is pretty low. If it does happen, we can re-assess.
